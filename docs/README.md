# StructureLogger

**StructureLogger** is a server-side utility mod for *Vintage Story* that logs the generation of world structures originating from the BetterRuins mod. It patches the vanilla `WorldGenStructure` class to emit detailed log entries for surface, underground, and underwater schematics placed during world generation.

To prevent log spam and improve clarity, vanilla structure logging is disabled by default and can be toggled at runtime via the `/slogger filter` command.

All log entries are prefixed for easy filtering and include schematic asset references and exact placement coordinates.
